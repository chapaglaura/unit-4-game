# **STAR WARS RPG**

## **What is it?**
A game in which you can fight as one of your beloved Star Wars characters (only four available as of now: Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Sidious, Darth Maul). Once you have chosen your fighter, the three remaining will become your enemies. Try to get their points to or below zero to win the game.

## **How to play:**
1. Choose one of the four main characters as your main fighter. You will fight with this character until the game finishes.

2. Your character’s possible enemies will appear to your right.

3. You have to strategically choose the order in which you will fight your enemies, as your attack power increases each turn and each enemy has a different counter attack power.

4. To attack, click the attack button and your enemy will automatically counter attack.

5. When you defeat an enemy, you can choose another one of them.

6. Once you defeat all three enemies, you can restart the game and choose another fighter.

7. If you lose, you can also restart the game.

8. Anyway, try not to lose. Good luck and have fun!

Note: You will be able to see your character’s health points and attack through the game progress, as well as your enemies’ points.
